## Introduction to SQLMap

SQLMap is a powerful open-source tool used for automating the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. This guide covers the basics of SQLMap, its capabilities, and advanced techniques to effectively use this tool.

### What is SQLMap?

SQLMap is designed to identify and exploit SQL injection flaws in web applications. It can detect and exploit various types of SQL injection techniques, including but not limited to time-based blind, error-based, union query-based, and boolean-based blind SQL injections. SQLMap is widely used in penetration testing and security assessments to uncover and exploit vulnerabilities in databases.

### Capabilities of SQLMap

SQLMap excels in automating SQL injection attacks to extract information from databases. Its capabilities include enumerating databases, tables, and columns, extracting data, and even accessing the underlying operating system.

### Use Cases: SQLMap vs. Other Security Tools

**SQLMap** is specialized for detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, offering deep database enumeration and automation.

**Web Application Scanners (OWASP ZAP, Nikto, etc.)** provide comprehensive scanning for various web application vulnerabilities and offer user-friendly interfaces and extensive reporting. However, they do not delve as deeply into SQL injection exploitation or Windows/Samba enumeration.

**Enum4linux** is specialized for enumerating information from Windows and Samba shares, offering detailed network configuration, user account, and share information, but it is not applicable to web application or SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Basic Usage

Understanding the command syntax and options is essential for effectively using SQLMap. This section outlines the basic structure and common options available.

### Command Syntax

The basic syntax for SQLMap commands is:

```bash
sqlmap [options] -u [target URL]
```

- **[options]**: Various flags to customize the scan and exploit process.
- **[target URL]**: The URL of the web application to be tested.

### Common Options

Here are some common options used in SQLMap commands:

- **`-u`**: Specifies the target URL.
- **`--batch`**: Runs in non-interactive mode.
- **`--dbs`**: Enumerates databases.
- **`--tables`**: Enumerates tables.
- **`--columns`**: Enumerates columns.
- **`--dump`**: Dumps the database contents.
- **`--passwords`**: Retrieves password hashes.
- **`--level`**: Sets the level of tests to perform (1-5).
- **`--risk`**: Sets the risk of tests to perform (1-3).

## Database Enumeration

SQLMap can enumerate databases, tables, and columns from the target system.

### Listing Databases

To list databases on the target system:

**Example Command**:

```bash
sqlmap -u [target URL] --dbs
```

- **`--dbs`**: Enumerates databases.

### Listing Tables

To list tables within a specific database:

**Example Command**:

```bash
sqlmap -u [target URL] -D [database name] --tables
```

- **`-D [database name]`**: Specifies the database to enumerate tables from.
- **`--tables`**: Enumerates tables.

### Listing Columns

To list columns within a specific table:

**Example Command**:

```bash
sqlmap -u [target URL] -D [database name] -T [table name] --columns
```

- **`-D [database name]`**: Specifies the database.
- **`-T [table name]`**: Specifies the table.
- **`--columns`**: Enumerates columns.

## Data Extraction

SQLMap can extract data from the databases.

### Dumping Data

To dump data from a specific table:

**Example Command**:

```bash
sqlmap -u [target URL] -D [database name] -T [table name] --dump
```

- **`--dump`**: Dumps the data from the specified table.

## Password Cracking

SQLMap can retrieve and crack password hashes.

### Retrieving Password Hashes

To retrieve password hashes from the database:

**Example Command**:

```bash
sqlmap -u [target URL] --passwords
```

- **`--passwords`**: Retrieves password hashes.

### Cracking Passwords

Once hashes are retrieved, use tools like **John the Ripper** or **Hashcat** to crack them.

## Advanced Techniques

Advanced techniques in SQLMap include bypassing web application firewalls (WAFs) and using custom scripts for automation.

### Bypassing WAFs and Filters

SQLMap can bypass some WAFs and filters with the `--tamper` option, which uses tamper scripts.

**Example Command**:

```bash
sqlmap -u [target URL] --tamper=[tamper script]
```

### Custom Scripts and Automation

Automating SQLMap with custom scripts can streamline the testing process.

**Example Script**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
target=$1
sqlmap -u $target --batch --dbs --tables --dump-all
```

## Monitoring and Managing Scans

Effective monitoring and management of scans are crucial for maximizing SQLMap's effectiveness.

### Output and Logging

SQLMap can output results to a file for later analysis.

**Example Command**:

```bash
sqlmap -u [target URL] --dump -o output.txt
```

- **`-o output.txt`**: Outputs results to the specified file.

## Ethical Considerations

It's crucial to use SQLMap responsibly and ethically. Ensure you have explicit permission to perform security testing on any network or system you target. Unauthorized use of SQLMap can lead to legal consequences.
